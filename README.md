Disclaimer: The project is still work in progress, everything said here is not finished but serves as an end goal.

Render the webpages that we want, the way we want. It just takes the html file (no css/js) and then renders as we decided. 
it aims to be lightweight, fast and useful. The goal to create renderers for the webpages we use but in the way we want: we can change the layout/style of the page we render as it is not a browser. It can support multiple layouts, color schemes if someone wants to do create new ones.

The browsers that I tried are always very ram/cpu heavy and I dont what that. Making a browser is a lot of work and it would not allow for optimizing the webpages that are not well made performance wise. So this is where the idea came from, a page renderer that supports only the pages that we want and in the way we want.

Lightweight & fast:
no heavy css/js processing
easy offline cache // TODO
it can keep only what is needed
